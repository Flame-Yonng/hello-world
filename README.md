# hello-world
This is the first repository of my account, including my self introduction and future plans.

Hello, I'm Flame, an undergraduate student. Majoring in machine learning of software engineering and hoping to improve my encoding ability, I signed up a new GitHub account to record my exercise and share them with you. Hoping we all could get what we want and make new progress every day.

The first file I'm going to create is the python programming questions I'd ever done. 
And the second in my plan is the machine learning exercise(I'll try my best to implement it)...
Maybe I'll upload some intesting document in my mind.

To be continued.
